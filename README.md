# WebGL-Train-Station
Interactive train station scene coded fully in WebGL and GLSL.

For security reasons most browsers will not allow the code to be run without being hosted by a server. 

An easy way to host all of the files if you have VS-Code and Python installed on your computer is to run

python -m http.server [PORT NUMBER]
in the VS-Code terminal in the root folder of the project

The project will then be accessable through a browser at 
http://localhost:[PORT NUMBER]/final/scene.html
